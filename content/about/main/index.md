 I am a recent graduate with a B.S.in Statistics and a minor in Math at Duke University. From my courses, I have become passionate about data science and the tangible effects it can have on improving human health and well-being. By integrating my understanding of statistical models and theories with quantitative skills in languages like R, Python, and Java, I hope to pursue a career that uses data for good. If you have any inquires, I can best be reached at aidan.gildea@duke.edu. I look forward to hearing from you!
