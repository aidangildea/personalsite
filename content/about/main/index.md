 I am a data programmer located in the DC area with a B.S.in Statistics from Duke University. From my work experiences and past courses, I have become passionate about data science and the tangible effects it can have on improving human health and well-being. By integrating my understanding of statistical models and theories with quantitative skills in languages like R, Python, and SQL, I aim to pursue a career that uses data for good. If you have any inquires, I can best be reached at aidan.gildea@duke.edu. I look forward to hearing from you!
