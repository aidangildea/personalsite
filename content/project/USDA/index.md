title: USDA Low-Cost Diet Nutrient Dashboard
---

### About this Project

In collaboration with researchers from Tufts University, Duke University and Penn State University, this interactive tool is part of the research project “From Scarcity to Prosperity: How Nutrition/Cost Tradeoffs Influence Consumer Choices and the Food System.” The data used in this dashboard are sourced from the 2013/2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the USDA/ERS Purchase-To-Plate Price Data Tool, and represents the consumption behaviors of women between 20-50 years old in the US. By harnessing insights from these interactive scatter plots, we can further understand the relationship between nutrient density and price, in turn, allowing us to achieve a more nutritional and affordable diet.

### Nutrient Dashboard Tool

Built with accessibility and ease in mind, this interactive dashboard allows
user to identify affordable sources of different nutrients. This empowers them to eat a healthy and balanced diet, while remaining in budget. Explore the toll [here](https://rpubs.com/aidangildea/nutrientdashboard).

### Policy Report

Accompanying this data analysis project is a policy report detailing recommendations based on my research. Using the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan as my framework, I argue that Americans should derive more of their protein from plant-based foods in order to eat more nutritionally in an affordable way.
