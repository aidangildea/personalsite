### About

As part of a summer internship with Amgen Inc, I developed an interactive R shiny interface allowing my colleagues to optimize clinical trial roll out. While most of the data and information is protected by the company, the project is an example of how data science, visualization, and user interface design can promote the future of human health. By integrating country-level data, site-level enrollment rates, cost information, and therapeutic area specifications, the tool was able to develop an optimal geographic "footprint" for a clinical trial.  

If you would like a more in depth description of the interface design, feel free to contact me at aidan.gildea@duke.edu.
