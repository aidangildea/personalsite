title: Modeling the Visual Field For Young Glaucoma Patients
---

## About

As part of the course STA 440: Case Studies, we built spatio-temporal conditional auto regressive classification (CAR) models to predict early-onset glaucoma. By training these models on longitudinal visual field series of patients under 45, we were able to glean insight in the the progression and regionality of optical deterioration. Our model building process encoded visual field neighborhood dependencies via rook and queen adjacency matrices to better understand how location and adjacency impact expect visual field changes.
