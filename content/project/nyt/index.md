### About this Project

As part of my course STA 323: Statistical Computing, I harnessed the New York Times API to build an interactive database of all their historical articles. Employing R Shiny, I created an interface that allows users to specify a day in history and access all articles from the NYT from that specific paper. 

You can view the project code on [Github](https://github.com/Sta323-Sp22/midterm2-aidangildea).
