      <description>About this Project In this project, we investigated voter turnout rates over a 14-year period. We used data from IPUMS and the American Statistical Association that that were originally collected from surveys conducted by the United States Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics [1,2]. The surveys are part of a “Voting and Registration Supplement” of the Current Population Survey that occurs every two years after the November elections [3].</description>
